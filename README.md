# AlphacraftLauncher
This launcher aims to repurpose the original Minecraft Launcher from June 29, 2010. 

The launcher ,by default, downloads the 'Beta 1.1_02' version of Minecraft, as it was the last version of Minecraft to be released in 2010. 

**You need Java 8u261 or greater to run this application.**

## Issues
- - Game doesn't recognise authenticated accounts and will default to "Player".
- - Skin does not update for cracked accounts and will default to "Player.png".
> If you find any issues, please let me know about it! Thanks.
