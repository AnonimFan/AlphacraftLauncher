## Overview

__TwentyTen Launcher__ is built from the ground up to provide a modern and polished "Legacy"
Minecraft
experience while
reliving the game's evolution. It supports versions ranging from _Indev 0.13 (20091223-2)_ to
_1.5.2_,
providing players with the opportunity to discover hidden gems from the past. For an even more
authentic experience, the launcher also natively supports versions from _Infdev (20100629)_ to _Beta
1.2_02_.

It's important to note that the reason we've chosen to limit our version support is to ensure a
historically accurate experience. _Infdev (20100629)_ was the first version to be downloadable using
the original launcher, and _Beta 1.2_02_ was the last version to come with the original launcher.

> Please note that a minimum of Java 7 or greater is required to run this application.
