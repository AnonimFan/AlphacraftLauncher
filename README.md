## What is AlphacraftLauncher?
AlphacraftLauncher is a repurpose of the original Minecraft Launcher released on 29 June 2010.

It enables you to play versions from **infdev (20100629)** all the way to **Beta 1.2_02** as they were the start and end of the original launcher.

By default, AlphacraftLauncher will download **Beta 1.1_02** as it was the last version of Minecraft to be released in 2010, and is what powers 'AlphaPlace', the popular legacy Minecraft server.

> You need a minimum of Java 8 or greater to run this application.

## Features
- You can sign in using *valid* Microsoft accounts, Mojang accounts, Legacy accounts, and 'cracked' usernames.
  - To sign in with a *valid* Microsoft account, enter "**$MS**" in the 'Username' field.
  - To sign in with a *valid* Mojang account, enter the **email address** in the 'Username:' field
  - To sign in with a *valid* Legacy account, enter the **username** in the 'Username:' field.
  - To sign in using a 'cracked' username, leave the 'Password:' field empty.
- Support for skins and appropriate sounds for different Alpha/Beta versions of Minecraft.
- Out-of-box compatibility with MCPatcher (HDTextureFix) and legacy mods (ModLoader).
- Automatic update checking that will tell you so in the login panel, just like in the original!
