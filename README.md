## Overview

__TwentyTen Launcher__ is a modern and polished remaster of the original Minecraft Launcher from
June 29, 2010. Developed from the ground up, this launcher offers a seamless and nostalgic
experience for fans of Minecraft's early days.

With support for versions ranging from _Indev 0.13 (20091223-2)_ to _1.5.2_, players can relive the
game's evolution and discover hidden gems from its past. For those looking for an even more
authentic experience, the launcher also natively supports versions from _Infdev (20100629)_
to _Beta 1.2_02_.

It's important to note that the reason we've chosen to limit our version support is to ensure a
historically accurate experience. _Infdev (20100629)_ was the first version to be downloadable using
the original launcher, and _Beta 1.2_02_ was the last version to
come with the original launcher.
