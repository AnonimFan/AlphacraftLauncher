<div align="center">A modern remaster of the original Minecraft Launcher from June 29, 2010</div>

----
This repository was created to provide a modern and polished "Legacy" Minecraft experience. It
covers a range of versions from _Indev 0.13 (20091223-2)_ to _1.5.2_, offering players the chance to
uncover hidden treasures from the past. To further enhance the authentic experience, the launcher
also supports _Infdev (20100629)_ to _Beta 1.2_02_ natively.

It is worth mentioning that the reason for limiting version support is to guarantee a historically
accurate experience. _Infdev (20100629)_ was the earliest version that could be downloaded using the
original launcher, while _Beta 1.2_02_ was the final version to come with the original launcher.

> Please be advised that this application requires a minimum of Java 7 or higher to run.
