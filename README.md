# TwentyTen Launcher

## Overview
TwentyTen Launcher (TTLauncher) is a modified version of the original Minecraft Launcher, which was released on June 29, 2010.

It is capable of running versions of Minecraft ranging from indev 0.13 (20091223-2) to 1.5.2. These versions were chosen because they were the first and last to support the legacy working directory system and the loading of the 'net.minecraft.client.MinecraftApplet' class. If you want to be historically accurate, you can start with infdev (20100629) and end at Beta 1.2_02.

__It is important to note that you will need a minimum of Java 8 or greater to run this application.__
## Features
- Sign in using a valid Microsoft or Mojang account.
- Manage various indev, Alpha, and Beta versions of Minecraft through instances.
- Support for skins and the usage of sound proxy.
- Out-of-box compatibility with MCPatcher (HDTextureFix) and ModLoader.
