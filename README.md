## What is AlphacraftLauncher?
AlphacraftLauncher is a repurpose of the original Minecraft Launcher released on 29 June 2010.

It enables you to play versions from **infdev (20100629)** all the way to **Beta 1.2_02**, as they were the start and end of the original Minecraft Launcher.

By default, AlphacraftLauncher will download **Beta 1.1_02**, as it was the last version of Minecraft to be released in 2010, and is what powers 'AlphaPlace', the popular legacy Minecraft server.

> You need a minimum of Java 8u261 or greater to run this application.
